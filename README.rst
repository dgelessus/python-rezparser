``rezparser``
=============

A pure Python library for parsing Macintosh Rez source files, which are used by the legacy ``Rez`` and ``DeRez`` tools to compile, modify and decompile Macintosh resource fork data.

**Note: This project is in very early development. Anything can (and probably will) change at any time.** If you encounter any bugs, please make an issue on the GitHub repo.

Requirements
------------

Python 3.6 or later, as well as `PLY`__ (tested with version 3.10, but older and newer versions probably work too).
